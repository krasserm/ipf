/**
 * A JAXB {@link XmlAdapter} that allows the Name class to be serialized.
 * <p/>
 * The original implementation of the {@link Name} class was concrete and had no subclasses. The XML serialization of
 * a {@link Name} used to look like this:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 * <name>
 *    <given>John</given>
 *    <family>Doe</family>
 * </name>
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * When the {@link Name} class was made abstract, the xml above could no longer be serialized. This adapter allows
 * the XML shown above to be serialized without change.
